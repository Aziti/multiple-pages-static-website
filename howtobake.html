        I am a first time croissant baker. What is your best advice?
        <p>
          Choose a cold day with a room temperature below 20 ÂºC / 68 ÂºF for your
          first attempt. This way you will have more time for the whole process
          and less chance of butter being absorbed by the dough. The key is to
          keep the butter solid between the layers of dough, this is what gives
          the croissant its flakiness.

        Can I turn your croissant recipe into a sourdough version?

        <p>
          We would recommend finding a recipe that is already a worked out
          version for sourdough croissants. We are not really a fan of the sour
          taste in pastry and for that reason we do not have enough experience
          to guide you to a good enough result.

        My butter breaks into pieces. What should I do?
        <p>
          We use organic butter with a high fat content and low water content
          (about 82% fat). A higher water content tends to make butter hard,
          which promotes tearing and breaking and ruins the layers. Your butter
          needs to be pliable and at the same time not too soft at the moment of
          usage.

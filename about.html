        Croissant, the iconic French pastry... What if we were to tell you that
        history of the croissant suggests that it may not be French at all!? In
        this article, we dive into the history and the facts and myths about the
        croissant.

        <p>
          When you think about a fresh, flaky croissant, you probably conjure up
          images of Paris. A lazy morning on the Left Bank, a small round table,
          reading Le Journal with a steamy cup of café au lait, and of course,
          that croissant. That warm, buttery croissant. Crispy on the outside,
          light and fluffy on the inside. Enjoyable on all sides and in every
          way imaginable.
        </p>

        One bite of a croissant just pulled from the oven at Michel Lyczak’s
        bakery in the southern Parisian suburb of Malakoff is bliss: a
        satisfying crunch and scattering of crumbs, the indulgent mouthfeel of
        butter wrapped in the overwhelming sensation of lightness. Few foods are
        as culturally iconic as this flaky breakfast food, so quintessentially
        French that many English speakers defer to its native pronunciation
        (krwa-sohn).

          After flattening and folding the dough, he cuts it into triangles by
          hand, then refrigerates it for 12 hours to ferment. “If you don’t do
          that,” he explains, “you won’t get the layers and just end up with
          bread.”

        <p>
          Similar to what the French today call pains au lait or “milky breads”,
          often eaten for breakfast or afternoon snacks, kipferl are now
          traditionally made with milk, wheat flour, sugar, butter, and a bit of
          salt. Some even bear a resemblance to bagels, though they’re not first
          dipped in a baking-soda bath before being put in the oven.
